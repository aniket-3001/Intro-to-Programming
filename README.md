# Intro-to-Programming
Welcome to my Introduction to Programming (IP) repository!

In this repository, you will find a collection of code implementations from my IP course at my college, IIITD.

I strongly advise all viewers to refrain from using this material in any unethical manner. Please engage with the content responsibly, leveraging it as a tool for study, review, and inspiration to develop your own unique solutions and understanding of programming fundamentals.
